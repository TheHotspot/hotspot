  Other Notes:
    All searches are currently performed by location only. Eventually we'll add
    in more searching parameters, such as by name, categories, etc.
    
    Male scans + Female scans will probably not be equal to the current_scanned
    since many people will likely not specify a gender upon signing up.

  Other Notes:
    Users are automatically flagged as having left a location if they either
    scan in somewhere else or if they don't scan in for a given period of time
    (which we haven't determined yet. It's currently set to 6 hours for testing).
    This particular request is only necessary for if the user explicity says
    that they are leaving their current location.

SCAN HISTORY

  API URL: /api/history
  
  Required Cookies:
    "sessionid" - The django session ID set upon login.

    "history" - List of scan history. Each result Contains:
       "scan_id" - Unique ID for the scan.
       "hotspot_id" - The corresponding hotspot ID
       "scan_date" - The moment when the scan occured
       "current" - 1 if it is their current scan, 0 otherwise.
  
  Other Notes:
    There should be at most ONE history result with the current flag set to 1.
    It is not unusual to have no results with the current flag. To be considered
    current, the scan must have happened within 6 hours, must be their most
    recent scan, and cannot have been "scanned out".
